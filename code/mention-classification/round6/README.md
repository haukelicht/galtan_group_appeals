In this sixth step, we perform mention attribute dimension classification using the SetFit framework, specifically focusing on model selection.

1. We trained setfit classifiers to classify mentions into economic attributes and noneconomic attributes, respectively, using many different models and mention-in-context formatting strategies.
2. This yields out.of-sample performance estimates we use for identifying the best-performing model and formatting strategy combinations for each attribute dimension.
