# Structuring Invocations of Social Groups

A central challenge in studying group references lies not in detecting that political actors refer to social groups, but in determining how such references should be structured analytically. The scale of this challenge is substantial. Even within a single country, party discourse contains thousands of distinct group references. For example, party manifestos of the UK Labour and Conservative parties between 1964 and 2015 contain more than 2,700 unique mentions of social groups (Thau 2019; Licht & Sczepanski 2025).

A growing body of research has begun to measure and map such references, often linking group mentions to specific frames, such as positive or negative appeals (Riethmüller and Franzmann 2025; Dodeigne 2025; Horne et al. 2025
; Huber 2022), representational claims (Gevers et al. 2024; De Mulder et al. 2025), or distinctions between identity and non-identity groups (Stuckelberger and Tresch 2024) and social classes (Thau 2019, Thau et al. 2022). These approaches have generated important insights when applied to specific research questions. However, we argue that such frameworks are less suitable as general taxonomies of social group references, as they often inherit classifications shaped by demand-side perspectives or conflate group attributes with the framing of groups. As a result, they may limit our ability to capture the full variety of group appeals observable from a supply-side perspective as well assume positional or Identity frames where they need to be measured first.

For example, women, ethnic or sexual minorities are often associated with cultural or identity conflicts, whereas the working class is commonly framed in predominantly economic terms (Bornschier, 2015; Kriesi et al., 2008, 2012; Stuckelberger & Tresch, 2022). While such associations may appear plausible in some perspectives, they should not be assumed when analyzing how parties invoke social groups. In practice, groups such as women or the working class can be framed in multiple ways, combining cultural, identity-based, and economic-redistributive narratives. Even class politics depended on organizational mediation and strategic articulation by parties rather than simply reflecting pre-existing social structures (Przeworski & Sprague, 1986; Thau 2021), and parties may actively construct class identities and group boundaries through political discourse (De Leon, 2015). Similarly, feminist scholarship has long emphasized that gender injustice is simultaneously economic and cultural, requiring attention to both redistribution and recognition (Fraser, 2013). More broadly, Polanyi's (\[1944\] 2001) insight that economic and social orders are co-constitutive suggests that conflicts over redistribution are inherently also conflicts over social belonging and moral order. Together, these perspectives caution against treating particular groups as inherently economic or identity-based and instead point to the flexibility with which political actors frame social groups in practice.

We therefore propose to separate the classification of group references from the analysis of group framing. Structuring the observed variation in group references instead requires addressing three interrelated questions: on what basis group mentions should be distinguished, at what level of abstraction these distinctions operate, and whether---and how---to account for intersectionality. We address these questions in turn.

## From Classes and Identities to Attributes

We first address how social group references should be distinguished analytically. While scholars broadly agree that understanding when, why, and how political actors invoke social groups is important, there is less agreement on what constitutes a social group in the first place.

Our central claim is that social groups should be defined by the attributes political actors invoke in discourse. Attributes are measurable properties, and a single attribute---or a combination of attributes---can delineate a collective of people. Following Sczepanski and Licht (2025, 1), we therefore define social groups as collectivities sharing one or more attributes, which may include economic characteristics, nationality or ethnicity, shared values, or other meaningful attributes. This attribute-centered perspective serves two purposes. First, it keeps the analysis open to the full universe of supply-side group references, avoiding restrictions inherited from demand-side or socio-demographic classifications. Second, it separates the identification of social groups from their political framing, allowing groups to be classified independently of whether they are invoked in economic, cultural, moral, or identity-based terms, which can then be analyzed in a distinct step.

This view is not incompatible with existing approaches but departs from much current work, which often relies on predefined socio-demographic categories or survey-based group lists (Wlezien & Miller, 1997; Dolinsky, 2021, 2023; Huber, 2022; Riethmüller et al., 2024). Such strategies facilitate links to demand-side perspectives and its indicators but restrict analysis to groups assumed to be salient in socio-demographic classifications, thereby excluding many groups invoked in political discourse. Recent efforts to systematize group appeals similarly aggregate references into sets aligned with traditional cleavages (Dolinsky, 2023; Horne et al., 2025; Stuckelberger & Tresch, 2024), implicitly carrying assumptions about which groups matter politically and how they are framed.

These tendencies reflect the long dominance of structural and identity-based perspectives. Structural accounts define groups through positions in enduring social relations and institutions (Lipset & Rokkan, 1967; Dalton, 1984, 2008; Kriesi et al., 2008, 2012; Piketty et al., 2018, 2021), treating groups as products of social structure rather than objects of political communication. Identity-based approaches, drawing on social identity theory, conceptualize groups through processes of self-categorization and belonging (Ashforth & Mael, 1989; Hogg, 1992, 2016). While both traditions provide important insights, they are less suited as foundations for a supply-side taxonomy.

In constrast, other approaches move closer to a supply-side perspective by defining social groups as collectives sharing meaningful attributes, including values and lived experiences (Chandra, 2012; Zuber et al., 2025; Wolkenstein & Wratil, 2021). Empirical work shows that attributes such as being "hard-working" or "morally upright" play an important role in political boundary-making (Zollinger, 2022; Sczepanski, 2023), and that even economically defined groups often anchor claims in cultural terms (Zollinger, 2024). However, these approaches often lack scalable strategies for systematic measurement and equally struggle to separate the attribute basis of a group references from its accompanying frames. We like to reiterate that we are agnostic about whose perspective is the most powerful in explaining the formation of political alignments between social groups and parties, but we provide a taxonomy of social group references that is open to validate the different views empirically.

In short, a strictly attribute-centered perspective allows us to map the universe of invoked groups without importing structural or identity-based assumptions into supply-side analysis. While this approach enables us to group diverse verbatim references into meaningful categories, attributes alone do not yet provide a workable taxonomy, as many attributes are nested within hierarchical levels of abstraction that must also be systematically accounted for.

## A Hierarchy of Attribute Abstraction

Political parties do not only choose *which* social groups to invoke but also vary the level of abstraction at which these groups are defined. Group appeals may target highly specific collectivities---such as "nurses," "small business owners," or "single mothers"---or broader and more abstract categories, including "working people," "ordinary citizens," or even "the people" (see also Thau 2019 or Horne et al. 2025). This flexibility reflects a central dimension of party communication: the capacity to adjust the inclusiveness and vagueness of group boundaries to expand or narrow potential appeals (Damhuis and Karremans, 2017; Evans and Tilley, 2017; Horn et al., 2021).

This flexibility motivates the second core element of our taxonomy: the hierarchy of abstraction. Social group appeals differ systematically in how concretely or abstractly group boundaries are drawn, ranging from highly specific collectivities to universalized categories that approach claims of general representation. Treating all social groups as operating at the same level of abstraction obscures a central dimension of group references and limits comparability across contexts. By explicitly capturing variation in abstraction, our taxonomy enables a more precise and generalizable analysis of how parties potentially construct, expand, or narrow social groups.

Classic theories of political representation already emphasize the importance of abstraction in political claims-making. Pitkin (1967) distinguishes between descriptive references to concrete constituencies and more abstract claims to represent general interests. Similarly, Downsian models of electoral competition imply incentives for parties to frame appeals in increasingly inclusive terms as they seek to maximize electoral support (Downs, 1957). From this perspective, abstract group appeals can function as coalition-expanding devices, allowing parties to appeal simultaneously to heterogeneous constituencies without committing to narrowly defined distributive claims.[^2]

This logic has been further developed in research on populism and mass politics. Populist appeals are having been characterized precisely by their reliance on highly abstract and universalized group categories---most notably "the people"---which remain intentionally vague and elastic (Laclau, 2005; Mudde & Kaltwasser, 2017). Such abstraction enables parties to fuse diverse grievances and social positions under a common label, facilitating broad but internally heterogeneous coalitions. Importantly, this strategy is not limited to populist actors. Mainstream parties also rely on abstract categories such as "ordinary consumers," or "citizens," which combine inclusiveness with normative evaluation while avoiding precise socio-structural specification (Zollinger, 2024).

Research on cleavage politics and realignment further shows that shifts toward more abstract group references often accompany periods of social and electoral change. As traditional class or religious anchors weaken, parties increasingly rely on higher-level group categories that cut across established divisions, such as "the middle class," "the majority," or "society at large" (Kriesi et al., 2008, 2012; Dalton, 2008). These appeals are rationalized allow parties to bridge fragmented electorates while retaining interpretive flexibility regarding who is included in the invoked group. Other studies have suggest that parties nowadays increasingly refer to the same broad and neutral groups, considering all classes as potential constituencies (Damhuis and Karremans, 2017; Evans and Tilley, 2017; Horn et al., 2021). 

From a constructivist perspective, varying levels of abstraction are best understood as a discursive resource. Laclau and Mouffe's (1985) theory of articulation highlights how abstract signifiers can function as nodal points that temporarily stabilize meaning while remaining open to multiple interpretations. Abstract group appeals thus enable parties to construct equivalences between otherwise disparate social groups, whereas more concrete appeals emphasize differentiation and targeted representation.

Recent research on social group appeals has made important strides in systematically identifying and categorizing group mentions. These studies differ in how they handle levels of abstraction. Several adopt a single-level approach, such as Huber (2022), who relies on fixed survey items, or Riethmüller et al. (2024), who use CSES socio-demographic variables. Other contributions implement two-level hierarchies, where concrete mentions are aggregated into broader categories: Thau (2019; 2024) distinguishes economic versus non-economic groups, Dolinsky (2021; 2023) clusters mentions into socio-demographic classes, and Stückelberger and Tresch (2024) combine concrete mentions with alignment-based categories.

While these approaches provide merit for specific research questions, the hierarchical organization of group categories has typically been treated as a technical step rather than a central analytical dimension. Explicitly incorporating levels of abstraction as a feature allows us to better capture how parties may vary the inclusiveness or universality of their appeals as well as avoiding problematic comparison across levels or across nested group categories. We suggest to think of at least three level, (1) attribute dimensions, (2) attribute categories, (3) specific group attributes.

### Attribute Dimensions

Many existing approaches implicitly distinguish between "economic" and "non-economic" or a "cultural" group dimensions (e.g., Thau, 2019; Horne et al., 2024). We adopt this intuition but reformulate it in attribute-centered terms. At the most abstract level, social groups can be organized along three broad attribute dimensions: universal, vertical, and horizontal. First, some references invoke universal groups, such as "the people" or "society," which include everyone and therefore do not distinguish between insiders and outsiders.

All other groups are defined by attributes that differentiate between those who belong and those who do not. These attributes may relate either to economic positions and activities or to attributes unrelated to economic roles. To avoid importing framing assumptions, we refer to these dimensions as vertical (economic) and horizontal (non-economic), drawing on terminology from inequality research while not adopting its broader theoretical implications.

Our terminology builds on Stewart's (2000, 2008) distinction between vertical and horizontal inequalities but adapts it for a different analytical purpose. Whereas Stewart distinguishes inequalities between individuals (vertical) from inequalities between culturally defined groups (horizontal), we use the distinction to categorize the attributes invoked in group references. Vertical group references are defined by attributes linked to economic positions or activities, while horizontal references rely on non-economic attributes. We prefer this terminology because the labels "economic" and "non-economic" can easily be conflated with economic or cultural framings of groups. Our taxonomy, by contrast, makes no assumptions about inequality structures or how groups are framed; it focuses solely on how parties delineate groups through attributes. Vertical groups are thus defined by attributes linked to economic roles or activities, horizontal groups by attributes unrelated to economic roles, while universal groups refer to collectivities for which boundary-making is absent.

### Attribute Categories

Defining abstract group dimensions naturally leads to a second level of abstraction: group categories. At this level, the literature shows considerable agreement on the types of categories that structure social group references. These categories are based on attributes that are mutually exclusive at the categorical level but broad enough to encompass a wide range of specific groups.

For example, employment-related categories include groups such as the unemployed, employees, or the self-employed, all defined by attributes related to employment status. Similarly, a gender category encompasses women, men, LGBTQ+ persons, and other groups defined by gender-related attributes.

Our taxonomy assembles a nearly comprehensive list of such attribute-based categories, designed to capture almost all empirical group references while ensuring that categories remain hierarchically coherent. Categories must therefore avoid to be nested within the attribute categories: highly specific groups are not treated as separate categories if they fall under a broader attribute category. For instance, health professionals do not constitute a separate category, as they are more appropriately included within the broader category of occupation- or profession-related groups.[^3]

### 2.2.3 Specific group references

Different to the attribute dimensions and the attribute categories, specific groups are often context-dependent and hierarchically nested within broader categories. At this level, groups are best understood as clusters of more concrete references that fall under shared attribute categories. For example, the gender category typically includes references to women, men, or individuals defined by LGBTQ+ attributes. While references to women or men are frequently specified through intersectional combinations---such as working women or older men--- other social groups such as LGBTQ+ references can also become more specific without necessarily invoking additional attributes. Moreover, identical group mentions may carry different meanings across historical and societal contexts. A party's reference to "families consisting of mothers, fathers, and children," for instance, might have appeared politically neutral in the 1960s but could be interpreted in more recent contexts as excluding non-traditional family forms. Conversely, different expressions may refer to the same group, as there are multiple ways of invoking men, workers, or occupational groups in political discourse.

Scholarship on ethnic politics and social categorization has long emphasized these features of social group construction. Constructivist approaches show that group categories are not fixed entities but context-dependent classifications activated and reinterpreted in political practice (Brubaker, 2004; Chandra, 2012). Similarly, research on symbolic and social boundary-making demonstrates how political actors continuously reshape group boundaries through discourse, allowing categories to shift meaning over time and across contexts (Lamont & Molnár, 2002). Studies of classification systems further underline that social categories are historically contingent and hierarchically organized rather than natural or stable groupings (Bowker & Star, 1999).

Importantly, much of this literature originates in ethnic and identity politics research. While our taxonomy is not limited to ethnic or identity-based groups, these studies provide valuable insights into how political actors invoke, reshape, and contest group categories in practice. We generalize these insights beyond ethnic politics by proposing a taxonomy applicable to all social group references, allowing specific groups---regardless of context---to be systematically organized along broader attribute categories such as gender, occupation, nationality, or other defining attributes.

However, such a view indicates an "ontological break" in the taxonomy of social groups. Attribute dimensions and attribute categories can be deductively derived from the literature and provide a generalizable attribute taxonomy across contexts. In contrast, specific groups cannot be captured comprehensively through deduction., in fact a purely deductive approach would risk to miss important variation in the scope of relevant social groups as well as its meaning. We thus, suggest to approach these specific groups as empirical clusters within defined attribute categories such as occupation or gender; asking questions such as which social groups within the domain of gender are actually mentioned by whom. Even with allowing for such a fine-grained distinction of social groups, ranging from attribute dimensions over categories to specific groups, variation in social group references in not only introduced by varying degrees of abstraction, e.g. specificity but inflated by the opportunity of political actors to fuse different attributes across and/or within the layers of abstraction. In short, intersectionality of group attributes is a defining feature of political communication.

## Intersectionality

Intersectionality has become central across the social sciences because it reconceptualizes social structure and inequality as the product of interacting rather than additive dimensions of difference, such as class, race, gender, culture, and territory (Crenshaw, 1989; Collins, 2000; McCall, 2005). From this perspective, social groups cannot always be reduced to single attributes: intersectional positions are more than the sum of their components and reflect historically specific configurations that cannot be inferred from any single attribute alone (Cho, Crenshaw, & McCall, 2013).

Despite broad agreement on its importance, empirical research on group appeals has not yet fully exploited intersectionality's analytical potential. Existing measurement strategies rarely deny its relevance, but typically operationalize group appeals by assigning each reference to a single defining category or attribute (e.g., Thau 2019, 2024; Dolinsky 2021, 2023; Huber 2022; Riethmüller et al. 2024; Stuckelberger & Tresch 2024; Licht & Sczepanski 2025). As a result, a central feature of political communication---the combination of attributes in group appeals---often remains invisible in empirical analyses.

This gap motivates the third core pillar of our taxonomy: intersectionality. We treat intersectionality not as a property of specific groups but as a general feature of group references. Ignoring intersectionality forces classifications to choose between attributes, producing both conceptual conflation and substantial information loss. For example, appeals to "working mothers" simultaneously invoke employment, family, and gender attributes; restricting classification to a single category obscures how frequently these attributes co-occur in political discourse.

Importantly, intersectionality operates at different communicative levels. It can occur within a single reference, when multiple attributes explicitly define a group, as in "working mothers." But it can also arise across references, when separate group mentions are discursively linked to construct coalitions that are likewise more than the sum of isolated constituencies. Existing measurement strategies typically miss the former because they assign only one category per mention, whereas the latter may still be observable when multiple group references are analyzed jointly. Intersectional effects may also emerge through discursive or organizational linkages that bind constituencies into broader political projects.

This logic is consistent with dominant approaches in party competition research, which show that political actors rarely mobilize groups in isolation. Coalition theory highlights how parties aggregate heterogeneous constituencies whose support can be jointly mobilized (Riker, 1962). Historical accounts of class politics demonstrate how labor parties combined class appeals with national, religious, gendered, or moral constituencies to build durable coalitions (Przeworski & Sprague, 1986; Eley, 2002; Howe et al., 2022). Contemporary realignment research shows how economic and cultural attributes jointly structure electoral coalitions (Kriesi et al., 2008, 2012; Piketty, Gethin, & Martínez-Toledano, 2018, 2021), while discursive approaches emphasize how heterogeneous demands are symbolically linked into broader political identities (Laclau & Mouffe, 1985; Mudde & Kaltwasser, 2017; Zollinger, 2024). Capturing intersectionality at the level of individual references is therefore crucial to preserve analytical granularity and avoid overlooking how parties explicitly construct social groups.

Taken together, combining attribute-centered classification, hierarchical abstraction, and intersectionality yields a comprehensive taxonomy of social group references, summarized in Figure 1
