    "In the case of economic attributes, PRR parties focus more heavily on _occupation/profession_ and less on _income/wealth/economic status_ than Green parties.\n",
    "This is consistent with the notion that PRR parties' group focus strategies are more oriented towards appealing to specific occupational groups (e.g., \"working class\", \"small business owners\") and less towards emphasizing economic inequality and redistribution as a core issue.\n",
    "Notably, despite its well-established role as a driver of voting behavior and its rising issue salience in recent decades [@cite], _education_ is relatively infrequently expressed in social group mentions by both party families.\n",
    "\n",
    "Regarding non-economic attributes, PRR parties emphasize _nationality_ and _crime_ more prominently than Green parties, while Green parties place greater emphasis on _age_ and _gender/sexuality_ as salient attributes for identifying and mobilizing social groups.\n",

    "We argue that intersectionality in parties' group mentions is an interesting facet of their group focus strategies.\n",
    "In this context, the question arises how to compare interesectionality patterns between groups.\n",
    "In our analysis, a key question along this line is whether PRR vs. Green parties combine attributes differently?\n",
    "\n",
    "There are multiple ways to quantify and compare attribute co-occurrence patterns.\n",
    "Each approach has its strengths and weaknesses.\n",
    "Below, we discuss four possible approaches and provide recommendations for their use.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Comparing conditional probabilities**:\n",
    "    We can compute $\\Pr(\\text{attribute B} \\mid \\text{attribute A})$ by party family and compare the values.\n",
    "    Conditional probabilities have the advantage that they are very interpretable, allowing statements like \"When Populist Radical-Right mentions class, 12% also mention gender.\"\n",
    "    They thus directly answers substantive questions about co-occurrence patterns.\n",
    "    Further, they do not suffer from base rate sensitivity issues like the PMI (see below).\n",
    "    Subtracting the values for Green parties from thjose for PRR parties, for example, we obtain an indicator that is negative if PRR parties tend to combine the given attributs more frequently.\n",
    "    Conditional probability differences can thus be compared across parties through simple subtraction, and the approach works well even with sparse data.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    The downside is that the measure is asymmetric, requiring careful interpretation. \n",
    "    Further, it does not account for statistical significance of observed differences.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    We therefore use it solely for _descriptive_ comparison of party families' attribute combination strategies.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Comparing statistical significance**:\n",
    "    We can apply $\\chi^2$ or Fisher's exact tests for each attribute pair to determine whether co-occurrence patterns differ significantly between party families.\n",
    "    These tests provide formal hypothesis testing and control for sampling variability. \n",
    "    Effect size measures, such as Cramér's $V$, in turn, allow assessing practical significance beyond mere statistical significance.\n",
    "    <!-- , and Fisher's exact test works reliably even with small cell counts. -->\n",
    "    \n",
    "    However, <!-- multiple comparison problems arise when testing many pairs simultaneously, requiring correction procedures like Bonferroni adjustment. The --> tests are sensitive to sample size, meaning that with large N, nearly everything becomes statistically significant. \n",
    "    Further, binary yes/no decisions do not capture the magnitude of differences.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    We therefore use significance testing for determining which attribute pair differences are statistically robust.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Comparing normalized Pointwise Mutual Information (nPMI)**:\n",
    "    We can compute nPMI values by party family, which compare observed to expected co-occurrence under statistical independence.\n",
    "    nPMI identifies unexpected patterns in both directions (positive associations where attributes co-occur more than expected, and negative associations where they co-occur less than expected). \n",
    "    Being normalized to a [-1, +1] scale, it allows comparing different attribute pairs.\n",
    "    This makes the nPMI metric useful for exploratory analysis.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    However, the measure is hard to interpret substantively in terms of party strategy. \n",
    "    It is sensitive to base rates, and negative values tend to dominate in sparse data (as we observed in our analysis). \n",
