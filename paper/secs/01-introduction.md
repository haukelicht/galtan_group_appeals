# Introduction

Political actors routinely refer to social groups, and such invocations play a central role in structuring political alignment between parties and constituencies.
Although social groups have long occupied a central place in the social sciences, research has primarily focused on how groups are defined by social structure (e.g., Blau and Duncan 1967; Lipset 1960; Lipset and Rokkan 1967; Goldthorpe 2007; Dalton 1984, 2008; Kriesi et al. 2008, 2012; Piketty et al. 2018, 2021) or experienced through identity (e.g., Tajfel 2010; Tajfel and Turner 2004; Achen and Bartels 2017; Huddy 2001; Brubaker 2024).
Much less attention has been devoted to how social groups are invoked and mobilized by political actors themselves.
Despite the recent emergence of supply-side approaches that measure group references (Licht and Sczepanski 2025; Farahani et al. 2024; ) and group appeals in party communication (e.g., Thau 2019, 2024; Dolinsky 2021, 2023; Stuckelberger 2019; Stuckelberger and Tresch 2024; Huber 2022; Riethmüller et al. 2024; Horne et al. 2025; Dodeigne 2025; Dausgard and Hjorth 2025; Amarales et al. 2025), scholars still lack a theoretically grounded and empirically scalable taxonomy for analyzing party references to social groups from a communicative perspective.[^1]

[^1]: Mentioned authors regularly use classification schemes but those do not follow a conceptually guided taxonomy, understood as hierarchical tree structured classification.

This article addresses that gap.
We develop a taxonomy of social group references from the perspective of political parties built around three principles.
First, group references are identified through the **attributes** political actors explicitly invoke rather than through presumed social positions or identity categories.
Second, we organize these attributes in a **hierarchical** taxonomy that captures how parties vary the level of abstraction at which groups are invoked, ranging from universal categories such as "the people" to highly specific groups such as "self-employed foreign nurses." Third, our attribute-centered taxonomy takes **intersectionality** seriously by recognizing that political actors routinely combine multiple attributes when referring to social groups such as for "self-employed foreign nurses."

Taken together, this framework provides an attribute-centered, hierarchical taxonomy that accommodates intersectional group references, improves comparability across contexts, reduces information loss, and minimizes bias by defining groups consistent with how parties themselves invoke them.
These principles further highlight that political actors possess substantial leeway not only to respond to existing social structures but also to shape and reconfigure social group boundaries (see also Brubaker 2004; Chandra 2012; De Leon 2015; Damhuis 2020; Westheuser and Zollinger 2025) through the combination of attributes and shifts in levels of abstraction.

This perspective provides a theoretically grounded starting point for addressing a central question in contemporary research: whether parties primarily respond to existing (Lipset and Rokkan 1967) and shifting group structures (Dalton 1984, 2008; Kriesi et al. 2008, 2012; Piketty et al. 2018, 2021; Bornschier et al. 2024) and/or actively participate in constructing them in an era of mass political communication (Brubaker 2004; Chandra 2012; De Leon 2015; Westheuser and Zollinger 2025; Damhuis 2020).
We thus show that developing a supply-side taxonomy of social groups is not merely a classificatory exercise but a prerequisite for an improved understanding of how political actors not only respond but also shape the social boundaries underlying democratic competition.
