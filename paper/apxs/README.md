# Appendix files

<span style="color: red;">Do NOT manually edit these files.</span>

The quarto `.qmd` files in this folder are created automatically by parsing the `0*.ipynb` files in [`secs/`](../secs/). 
The `.qmd` files are then included in the main paper via `include` statements in the main [`_main_.qmd`](../_main_.qmd) file.
