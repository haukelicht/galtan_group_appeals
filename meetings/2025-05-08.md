### (co-)occurrence of class, empl status and occupation/profession

- class
	- note: explicit class appeals very, very rare
	- but what about "workers"  => not class, only if explicit
	- what about employees, employers, business owners, ? => not class, only if explicit
	- "elites" (political) class => yes
- employment status
	- any occupation/profession => employment status? Νο!
	- pensioners a reference to employment status? => Yes (and not age!)
		- and if so, what about "seniors" ("Senioren") => this is age!
	- profession implies employment status? => No!
- occupation
	- "shareholder" a profession? => No!
	- "entrepreneur" a profession? => Yes
		- if so, also business owners? = Yes
	- "elites" a profession? = No (class), only if explicit (e.g., "political class")

- for future consideration
	- missing categories
		- non-econ
			- political affiliation
				- but conflict with shared values mentality
				- and where to draw the line to formally organized political group
			- shared experiences
				- but when is being poor a reference to econ status, and when (also) to shared experience?
