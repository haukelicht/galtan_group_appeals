## sheet age / family / gender (sheet 1)

- children: always age _and_ family? (currently yes)
	- if so, why not for "talented children (in particular - with dyslexia)" 
	- related: "kids"
	- **decision:** 
		- no, only age; 
		- only age + family if explicit in context!
- gender/sexuality if "father" and "mother"?
	- **decision:** no (only _family_), only if explicit


## sheet ethnicity / nationality (sheet 3)

- "multicultural"
	- ethnicity? => **yes**
	- nationality? => **yes**
	- religion? => **yes**
	- note: while implicit, all categories are 
	- but _shared values/mentalities_ only if explicit
- "foreign"/"domestic"
	- **decision:** always _nationality_
	- note: we _assume_ it focuses on differences defined by citizenship or country of origin (not place/location)
- "migration background": nationality or ethnicity?
	- **decision:** nationality
	- note: in the contexts we study, cross-national migration is much more in the focus; so we _assume_ that this type of mention implies differences defined by citizenship or country of origin
- "refugees" always nationality?
	- **decision**: treat equivalently to "migration background"
- "society" and "citizens"
	- always nationality?
		- "citizens" ==> yes
		- "society" ==> no
	- **decision** rule for "society"
		- **if** mentioned with defining attributes => focus on attrinbute
		- without attributes => _universal_
	- if not, what else?
