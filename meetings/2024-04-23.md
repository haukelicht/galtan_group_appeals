## hard cases and open questions

### code or not

41112_199012-126343	the richt industrial societies	"social orga", "universal", or none?
21112_199111-34799	a fair society	used as concept/idea instead of concrete group 
13229_199409-186613	a multicultural society	used as concept/idea instead of concrete group 
171101_201807-310728	"citizen ..."	I would say no but classifier might be confused
14110_200703-198879		7 social group mentions

### Where to draw the line

82721_201710-117729 "We also want to expand the military cooperation of the V4 countries."	why is "the V4 countries" not an orgsanizational group?
82721_201710-117729 "developing countries"	why is not an orgsanizational group?

### Extend

92436_200710-361722	Companies employing parents returning to work from maternity and parental leave will not pay contributions	only "parents" or "parents returning to work from maternity and parental leave"
41320_197610-119504	Women who take care of a household with children under the age of 8 are entitled to home aid ...	"Women" or "Women who take care of a household with children under the age of 8" (I'd say the latter because the appeal is to the specific category of women and not the children)
97110_199212-382830	"All adults with disabilities who have completed any form of education or training"	only "adults with disabilities" would be incomplete
13229_200502-190670	make many people unable to have children	only "people" or "people unable to have children"
11320_201009-395221	We remove the employer's fee for the person who employs a young unemployed and the person who offers an internship or trainee place receives the corresponding deduction.	"the person who employs a young unemployed" and "the person who offers an internship or trainee place"

### Translation errors

11710_201409-399294	small with up to 9 employees	should be "small businesses with up to 9 employees"
31110_201206-217131	incomplete female careers byining free quarters	should be "incomplete female careers by maintaining free quarters"
